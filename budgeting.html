    A quick tip about things that you spend onregularly and require; there are four speical numbers: - 12, 52, 250 and 365. The way this works is if you spend on something once a month, you just need to multiply it by 12 to get the annual cost. You can also work out 52 and 365.And 250? That's if it a daily act.£2.50 a day on a cup of tea? That's £500 a year.Necessary?</li>
